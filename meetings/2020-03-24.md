### nodejs/package-maintenance


* \[RFC\] Governance Models and Methodologies for Package Maintainers [#309](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/309)
  * No update this time, but Owen hopes to have time in next couple of weeks
    and have updates next time

* PkgJS Org for WG supported tooling [#271](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/271)
  * Now approve, next step is to tweak governance. Michael will look at that today/tomorrow
    
* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * Changes to doc are complete. Next step is to update the validation too.


* Tooling, a dependents tooling mechanism or help from the registry folks
  * Should talk to Darcy
    * Need to figure out which dependents are important
    * Today you have to scrape the registry.
  * Dominykas
    * If you can get full list of dependants, then there is API to get the
      number of download counts for each. 
  * Michael 
    * Andrew has been working on tool, needs to create repo in the pkgsorg.
      See https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/327
  * Dominikas, the other option is to replicate the data (40G) but that’s not
    a good option either.
  * Glen will set up meeting with npm
  * Michael to open issue with Andrew to request new repo for the tool.

* Would it be possible to get an overview of CITGM, as I believe some ExpressJS testing is
  already conducted.
  * When we test Express we test session, external DB.  Michael 99.9% sure we don’t.
  * Michael, gave quick overview.

* Shared CI configurations [321](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/321)
  * Michael will re-ping TSC and CommComm to see if we can close on approval.

* Andrew PR open to update express status board in order to address performance issues
  mentioned. @Wes could you review.  Glen will bring up in Express TSC meeting tomorrow.
  This is the pull request: https://github.com/pkgjs/statusboard/pull/10
