## Agenda

## Announcements
 
*Extracted from **package-maintenance-agenda** labelled issues and pull requests from the **nodejs org** prior to the meeting.

### nodejs/package-maintenance


* 2FA in CI [#282](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/282)
  * RFC is now linked on the issue.
  * Darcy link for schedule should be on npm.community. 

* Document the current 'top 10' express' issues [#233](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/233)
  * We had listed over in express the last 5 steps before Express 5 can be released
  * Some are getting consensus
  * Some are getting PRs landed

* Next steps on Support levels in Package.json [#192](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/192)
  * https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/pull/312 openened, lets discuss if we need
    more than this.
  * Seeing if we can get create-pkg, with npm can use modules with create-xxx on init.  Would 
    be useful for the package-maint team to be able to use it to build tool to do init.  This could
    be way for Support levels impl to land in a meaningful way.

* For awareness

  * Ruy - I would like to raise awareness to this WG that we are starting the work on an RFC to add support to monorepos/workspaces in npm - if anyone has strong opinions about it, I’m currently collecting feedback through user stories interviews and we can schedule a follow up meeting (or alternatively just feel free to express your opinions here if we have the time)

* Issue for separate tooling meeting
  * Bethany did not get enough response to the doodle. Will create a new one after the meeting
    to try again.

## Project Board Review (maybe, if time permits).
* We took a quick look through the board and at open issues

Ask participants about the state of [Project Board](https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/projects/1) and necessary changes if time permits.
