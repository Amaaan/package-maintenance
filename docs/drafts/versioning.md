# Versioning 

The package maintenance group requires that supported packages follow the issued 
npm [best practices](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning). Most packages 
that receive help are expected to already be following this guidance. However if a 
package is not already on a major semver release number we recommend on bumping up 
to version 1.0.0 on the next semver major release.

## Other versioning requirements
- Increasing the minimum required version of node is a 
breaking change and should be accompanied by major semver change.
-  release notes, in at least one of or possibly all of: in the commit message that bumps the version; in a changelog file in the version bump commit; in the tag annotation for the semver-tagged published commit.
