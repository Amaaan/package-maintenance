# Licensing

It is required that any package supported have an appropriate license. The 
maintainers may choose not to support a package with a license that is restrictive 
or may be construed as a patent license.

There are many licenses to choose from. We would refer package owners who have not 
already choosen a license to review the [commonly used SPDX licenses](https://spdx.org/licenses/) and 
[suggested means to choose license](https://choosealicense.com/).
